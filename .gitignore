# If you're thinking of un-ignoring any of these artefacts in a lower
# level .gitignore please think again. The none eclipse / maven options
# below are recommended candidates from http://help.github.com/ignore-files/
#
# As a general rule please don't commit:
#    IDE generated files, it upsets the IDEs of others
#    Compiled / built files (exes, jars, etc.), it's a source repository
#    Test data larger than a few KB, we'll go for bigger test files in the testbed
#
# Remember, we'd like to keep the git repo light and small enough for people to 
# download quickly and easily.
#
# Any questions then get in touch:
